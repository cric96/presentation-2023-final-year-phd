abstract="Swarm behaviour engineering is an area of research that seeks to investigate methods for coordinating computation and action within groups of simple agents to achieve complex global goals like collective movement, clustering, and distributed sensing. Despite recent progress in the study and engineering of swarms (of drones, robots, vehicles), there is still need for general design and implementation methods that can be used to define complex swarm coordination in a principled way. To face this need, this paper proposes a new field-based coordination approach, called MacroSwarm, to design fully composable and reusable blocks of swarm behaviour. Based on the macroprogramming approach of aggregate computing, it roots on the idea of modelling each block of swarm behaviour by a purely functional transformation of sensing fields into actuation description fields, typically including movement vectors. We showcase the potential of MacroSwarm as a framework for collective intelligence by simulation, in a variety of scenarios including flocking, morphogenesis, and collective decision-making.",

Macroprogramming approaches are motivated by the need of effectively capturing global/system-level aspects and the collective behaviour of multiple computational components, while abstracting over low-level details. Previously, this programming style had been primarily adopted to describe the data-processing logic in sensor networks; recently, research forums on spatial computing, collective systems, and the Internet of Things have provided renewed interest in macro-approaches. However, related contributions are still fragmented and lack conceptual consistency. Therefore, to foster principled research, an integrated view of the field is provided, together with opportunities and challenges.},

  abstract = {Swarm intelligence leverages collective behaviours emerging from interaction and activity of several “simple” agents to solve problems in various environments. One problem of interest in large swarms featuring a variety of sub-goals is swarm clustering, where the individuals of a swarm are assigned or choose to belong to zero or more groups, also called clusters. In this work, we address the sensing-based swarm clustering problem, where clusters are defined based on both the values sensed from the environment and the spatial distribution of the values and the agents. Moreover, we address it in a setting characterised by decentralisation of computation and interaction, and dynamicity of values and mobility of agents. For the solution, we propose to use the field-based computing paradigm, where computation and interaction are expressed in terms of a functional manipulation of fields, distributed and evolving data structures mapping each individual of the system to values over time. We devise a solution to sensing-based swarm clustering leveraging multiple concurrent field computations with limited domain and evaluate the approach experimentally by means of simulations, showing that the programmed swarms form clusters that well reflect the underlying environmental phenomena dynami}

  abstract        = {Engineering self-organising systems -- e.g., robot swarms, collectives of wearables, or distributed infrastructures -- is a notable research challenge, investigated and addressed through various kinds of approaches, e.g., automatic (such as learning-based) or manual ones. In this work, we focus on the latter, and specifically on programming language-based approaches. Our goal is to devise a declarative language for expressing self-organising behaviour able to abstract from low-level concerns (like scheduling and deployment), which can usually be optimised at the platform/middleware level. Currently, most of the state-of-the-art languages for self-organisation leverage a time-driven or proactive execution model, where devices repeatedly execute sense-compute-act rounds, which is simple to reason about but limited in terms of flexibility in scheduling and management of reactive behaviours. Motivated by this, and inspired by the functional reactive paradigm, in this work we propose a reactive self-organisation programming language that enables to decouple the program logic from its scheduling. Specifically, we implement the idea through a functional reactive implementation of aggregate programming in Scala, based on the functional reactive library Sodium. The result is a functional reactive self-organisation programming model, which maintains the same expressiveness and benefits of aggregate programming while enabling significant improvements in terms of scheduling controllability, flexibility in the sensing/actuation model, and execution efficiency.},

  abstract        = {Coordinating a multi-agent system of intelligent
situated agents is a traditional research problem, impacted by the
challenges posed by the very notion of distributed intelligence.
These problems arise from agents acquiring information locally,
sharing their knowledge, and acting accordingly in their environment in order to achieve a common, global goal. Individual
agents need to control how they share their knowledge in order
to not overburden the network or other agents with unnecessary
information. These problems are even more evident in large-scale
collective adaptive systems, where agent interactions are necessarily proximity-based, thus making the emergence of controlled
global collective behaviour harder.
In this context, two main approaches have been proposed
for creating distributed controllers out of macro-level task/goal
descriptions: manual design, in which programmers build the
controllers directly, and automatic design, which involves synthesizing programs using machine learning methods. In this
paper, we consider a new hybrid approach called Field-Informed
reinforcement learning (FIRL). We utilise manually designed
computational fields (globally distributed data structures) to
manage global agent coordination. Then, using Deep Q-learning
in combination with Graph Neural Networks we enable the agents
to learn the necessary local behaviour automatically to solve
collective tasks, relying on those fields through local perception.
This allows us to create distributed controllers informed by a
collective knowledge that has been distilled during learning, but
that uses only local information at runtime. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of this new approach in simulated use cases where
tracking and covering tasks for swarm robotics are successfully
solved.},
